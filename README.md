## Project Highlights
## Project Highlights
- **Second Place**: This project won second place in the 2024 Women in AI Canada Hackathon, competing against teams nationwide.

1. **Problem Statement**:
   - Women earn only 84 cents for every dollar earned by men, with 70% of the wage gap remaining unexplained by measurable factors.
   - Marginalized groups face even higher wage disparities.

2. **Solution**:
   - Developed an **AI-powered salary prediction and benchmarking tool** using:
     - **Random Forest Algorithm**: Predicts expected salaries and highlights discrepancies.
     - **SHAP and LIME**: Ensures transparency and explains the model's predictions.

3. **Impact**:
   - Drives gender pay equity.
   - Aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals:
     - SDG 5: Gender Equality.
     - SDG 8: Decent Work and Economic Growth.
